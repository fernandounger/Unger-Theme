# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder
* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your color theme extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the theme file.
and specifies the base theme of the theme.
* `themes/unger-theme.json` - the color theme definition file.

## Get up and running straight away
* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Open `File > Preferences > Color Themes` and pick your color theme.

## Make changes
* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Adopt your theme to Visual Studio Code
* The token colorization is done based on standard TextMate themes. Colors are matched against one or more scopes.
To learn more about scopes and how they're used, check out the [theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/themes-snippets-colorizers#_adding-a-new-color-theme) documentation.

## Install your extension
* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
* To share your extension with the world, read on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs about publishing an extension.
